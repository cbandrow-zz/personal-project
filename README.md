## Car-Tographer

### Description: 

Car-Tographer is an application that allows a user to identify a car from a photograph. The image is matched to potential results and returns potential car options. 

### Technology:

The application uses React.js for the UI, Express to host the site, and three different API's to bring back qualified car data. It uses Google's Cloud Vision API to grab potential images. It then uses Edmunds Vehicles API to grab car data about each vehicle, and uses Bing's Image Search API to grab images of different years of the vehicle, to allow the user to visually make a match and ensure their submitted car matches what the results bring back.
