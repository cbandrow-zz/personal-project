    "description": "Not only is the A3 the most affordable Audi in the lineup, this sedan or convertible is more practical and fun to drive than competing small luxury cars.",
    "introduction": "<p>Introduced in the mid-1990s in Europe and brought to the  United States in 2006, the A3 is Audi's entry-level model for the North  American market. Smaller and lighter than the A4, the Audi A3 presents a strong  argument for buying a bargain sport sedan, hatchback or convertible, provided  one goes easy on the options. But just because this is Audi's entry-level car  doesn't mean the company cut corners on quality. The cabin's design and  materials are up to the lofty standards Audi has set for the industry, meaning  everything fits tightly, moves with precision and looks and feels top-shelf.</p>\n<p>Body styles differ between the two generations, but since  its introduction, the A3 has been a classy alternative to mainstream compacts  yet still budget-friendly compared to its rivals. The current-generation A3 is  available in a sedan or convertible body style; the previous-gen version was  sold only as a hatchback in the U.S. No matter which version you get, the A3  offers the distinct German flavor of Audi, that being one of engineering  excellence combined with a rich, upscale cabin.</p>\n  <p><strong>Current Audi A3</strong><br>\n  The Audi A3 is sold as a sedan with seating for five or a  two-door convertible with four seats and a power-folding fabric roof. It's  available in three trims, regardless of body style: Premium, Premium Plus and  Prestige. The A3 is generously equipped in base Premium trim, with standard  features including xenon headlights, a rearview camera, leather upholstery,  dual-zone automatic climate control, a 10-speaker audio system with satellite  radio, and a panoramic sunroof for the sedan. Stepping up to the Premium Plus  adds an exterior body kit, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and  ignition, heated front seats, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.  The top-dog Prestige counts LED exterior lighting, adaptive cruise control, a  14-speaker audio system, a Wi-Fi hotspot and a wide-screen driver information  display among its upgrades. Options include a Sport package, 19-inch wheels and  a sport suspension.</p>\n<p>Under the hood of every A3 is a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine that makes 186 horsepower in front-wheel-drive models and  220 hp with all-wheel drive (Audi's Quattro). Transmissions are also split: The  FWD version gets a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission, and AWD  models have a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic.</p>\n<p>On the road, we've been impressed with the Audi A3's  grown-up personality; it feels more like an honest-to-goodness luxury car  rather than a fancy compact. The ride is composed and comfortable, the cabin is  quiet, and the turbocharged engine provides plenty of punch around town and on  the freeway. Superb fuel economy helps as well. Surprisingly, the A3 doesn't  feel especially sprightly when driving around town due to its somewhat light  and numb steering feel at lower speeds. However, it perks up when driven with  more enthusiasm. Particularly when equipped with all-wheel drive and the extra  power it brings, the A3 feels like a running back in bankers' clothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Used Audi A3 Models</strong><br>\n  The current-generation Audi A3 debuted in 2015, quickly  becoming is a top choice for an entry-level luxury car. Both body styles have  something to offer, whether you're looking for a sporty yet buttoned-up sedan  or a convertible that is surprisingly quiet with the top up. (Though if you  plan on bringing multiple friends to join in on the fun-in-the-sun antics,  consider the larger A5 droptop instead.) It's quite different than the A3  hatchback that preceded it. Although a solid performer in its own right, that  A3 felt (and looked) as if it had more in common with the Volkswagen Golf upon  which it was based than a car built from the ground up in Audi's wheelhouse.</p>\n<p>This second-generation A3 has received just a few updates  over the years. Originally, it came with one of three engines: the current  2.0-liter, plus a 170-hp turbocharged 1.8-liter gasoline engine and 150-hp  2.0-liter diesel. Audi discontinued the latter two after the 2016 model year.  Also note that these 2015-'16 A3s with the 2.0-liter gas engine and front-wheel  drive had the six-speed transmission and produced the full 220 hp. A revised  infotainment system (with a standard USB port instead of the Audi's proprietary  media interface plug and cord) and standard forward collision mitigation round  out the changes for 2017. </p>\n<p>The previous-generation Audi A3 was introduced as a 2006  model in the United States and was produced through 2013. There was no 2014  model. It came only in a four-door hatchback body style with enough cargo space  that some might consider it a small wagon.</p>\n<p>A 200-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four and front-wheel  drive were standard. Audi offered either a six-speed manual transmission or a  quick-shifting six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission (S tronic).  All-wheel drive was optional starting in 2009, and it came with the S tronic  transmission. From 2006 to 2009, a 3.2-liter V6 engine was available that  produced 250 hp. It was outfitted with all-wheel drive and the S tronic  transmission as standard. Starting in 2010, Audi began offering a 2.0-liter  diesel-powered engine (TDI) with 140 hp. It came with front-wheel drive only  and had the S tronic transmission.</p>\n<p>Originally, the A3 came in 2.0T and 3.2 Quattro trim levels.  Standard features on the 2.0T included 17-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic  climate control and a 10-speaker audio system. The S line package provided a sport-tuned suspension,  sport seats with leather upholstery and special exterior styling. The Premium  package also included some of the S line's items but added a power driver seat,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror and rain-sensing wipers. The 3.2 Quattro  included almost all of the equipment from the S line and Premium packages as  standard. Notable options on both trim levels were xenon headlights, a sunroof,  a navigation system, Bluetooth, iPod integration and a Cold Weather package.</p>\n<p>On the road, we found that this generation of A3 struck an  agreeable balance between athletic handling and a comfy ride. With the base  2.0-liter engine, it provided energetic acceleration along with good fuel  economy. The V6 was a little quicker, but not dramatically so. The A3 TDI's ample low-end torque  was nice around town, but the engine could feel winded at higher speeds. As for  passenger space, the A3's hatchback design provided some added versatility, but  the small rear seat was cramped for adults.</p>\n<p>The most significant changes for this generation took place  for 2009. The exterior and interior were refreshed, most notably with Audi's  signature larger grille and LED running lights. Leather upholstery, satellite  radio and an auxiliary audio jack became standard equipment, while the 2.0T  could now be equipped with all-wheel drive. For 2010, new Premium and Premium  Plus trim level names debuted. From then on through 2013, only minor equipment  updates took place.</p>\n",
